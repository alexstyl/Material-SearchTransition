# Material-SearchTransition

This is a sample project showcasing how a transition to Search can be achieved similar to how it can be found in the [Android stock Dialer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer).

The main difference to the implementation found in the stock Dialer app is that you have two separate Activities (MainActivity and SearchActivity) in the demo, as opposed to having a huge activity that has the logic for both.

The demo is using the [`Transition` API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/package-summary.html)  with a combination of custom Activity transitions.
